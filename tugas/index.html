        <p>The word strawberry is coined from 'strewn berries about the plants and 
            thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into "Strawberry" (Roger). They are 
            not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant. 
            The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There 
            are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and are 
            non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium 
            (Roger)

        <p>Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like, 
            stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries 
            were served up at medieval skate occasions as a show of peace, wealth, 
            and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is 
            at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very 
            well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).
